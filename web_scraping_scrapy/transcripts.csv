Trust Us (2022) - full transcript,"Trust Us tells the story of how the US slowly transformed from a constitutional republic into an administrative state, ruled by federal agency experts.","(tense contemplative music),- [Narrator] For 100 years,,we've been the guinea pigs,in a grand experiment.,Can managers, experts and,bureaucrats more efficiently plan,and run our lives than we can?,Does society flourish,when a select few determine,the path for the many?,Experts are critical to,evaluating, judging, and planning,,but shouldn't we be in,charge of our own lives?,(static hisses),- [Announcer] Let's start,with you and what you want.,(soft bright music),What does anybody want?,Millions have worshiped the strong man.,Millions let somebody else decide,what they want by fear, by force.,(speaks in foreign language),(crowd yells),Yeah, a dictator.,Over here, we don't like dictators.,Our government represents us, the people.,Our government is our,servant, not our master,,and it makes a lot of difference to you,what you can do and what you can't do.,Limitations of our rights? Sure.,But for the public good,,and that's the way our,country has gone ahead.,(static hisses),(contemplative music),- It was the year of,science, turn of the century.,Every day, new ideas came out.,Society was changing much more rapidly,than it ever had before.,An important figure was Speedy,,Frederick Winslow Taylor.,Speedy was his nickname,,and Speedy was the great efficiency expert,who helped us to get the assembly line.,- Industry was this,enormous thing that erupted,during that time, and apparently,,Taylor could improve productivity.,(flames rumble),(muffled speaking),- He would observe industrial processes,,and he would figure out how,to make them more efficient.,- [Narrator] The guy was obsessed,with scientific precision.,His own peers called him authoritarian,because he brought that obsession,with precision into everything he did.,He believed everything,,especially factory work,,could be perfected through science.,- [Amity] One of the places,Frederick Taylor worked,was at Bethlehem Steel,,where they were trying,to get more productivity,out of a worker.,- [Narrator] And as,providence would have it,,the Spanish-American War sparked a surge,in demand for American steel.,Large demand for steel means,Bethlehem Steel Company,must move product,,80,000 tons off the train,cars and into the yard.,In fact, they were,struggling in comparison,to other steel plants.,The workers were already the lowest paid,and likely a third as efficient.,With a desperate need to,improve Bethlehem Steel,and a theory that could change everything,,this was Frederick's time to strike.,- Frederick Winslow Taylor was the founder,of scientific management.,Why don't we figure out,what's the one best way,,the one best sequence of,actions to get this, that,,or the other task done,in this large factory?,- Taylor believed that we,could all do things better,,and that's fine, and factories,could be more productive.,Definitely true.,But he also believed that,people need to be categorized.,He actually said, ""Some people are stupid.,They're like oxen. They,need to work an ox's job.,Other people are bright.,They need their college men.,They need to study the,oxen and help the oxen,and order the ox around."",- So that was the principle,of Taylorism is top down.,""Science is what makes me,a legitimate authority,,and you who don't have science,must be totally disempowered.,You're just cluttering the system."",- [Narrator] It was Frederick's theory,of scientific management,that made this possible.,Take any job and reduce,it to its simplest,,most efficient tasks, steps, and motions,,and motivate the right person,to work as efficiently as possible.,Most of these men collapsed,from working too hard and refused,to complete Taylor's first,experiments in efficiency.,Taylor later found one in particular,who could outperform the rest.,A Pennsylvania Dutchman,Frederick had nicknamed Schmidt,was all he needed to prove his theory.,Frederick had Schmidt hustling up,and down wooden planks,to achieve his goal,,and in a single day, Schmidt achieved,what took the average worker,an entire week's work.,Taylor took backbreaking work,and made it extremely,profitable for his career.,Taylor's cult of scientific,efficiency was born.,- [Amity] Taylorism was enormously popular,because the early progressives,were after progress.,- [Narrator] Harvard, Penn State, Cornell,,Purdue all converted his lectures,into the world's first MBA programs,where influential intellectuals were eager,to impose an ideology that,,not only can every corner,of society be planned and controlled,from the top down, but that it must be.,- The progressives,really took this question,of national efficiency,,and they took Taylor's ideas,and they saw applications,of those ideas well beyond the plant.,Taylor himself says, ""We,can apply this not just,to industrial management,,but we can apply it to religion.,We can apply it to private philanthropies.,We can apply it to the farms."",It was an economic idea,,but then there were people,during The Progressive Era,in the early 20th century,who said, ""This is an,idea really that applies,across a whole range of,things, including politics."",- The progressives were one,of the first intellectual,movements that viewed society,as a big company, let's say,,or just a big organization,that needs to be managed.,- Taylorism then became,the idea that the expert,can come along, tell the,non-expert how to do it,,whatever it might be.,- It essentially believed,that if you had enough science,and enough power, you could,fix the human condition.,(dark brooding music),- I think Taylor's ideas led directly,to the enshrinement of expert government,,the idea that experts should be involved,in making all of the decisions.,- [Narrator] Everything we do suddenly,requires more scientific,management. Personal hygiene,,diet, child rearing, housing, posture,,recreation, family structure.,- And I think the 20th,century took that model,into its politics.,- [Narrator] Government control.,- The idea is that that we human beings,are there to be controlled,,and there is a scientific,way for us to be,,and then they use this information,when making their directives to us.,They issue their commands based,upon what they've learned.,That's the big mistake.,That's the category mistake.,A country is not a company.,- [Narrator] And we would continue to read,what the world's first,management expert sowed.,Within a few decades of,Frederick's experiments,,the consent of the government was about,to be delegated to the experts.,Revolution had ripped through Russia,,and Vladimir Lenin had a,worm in his stomach for more,,but food and power were scarce,,and things were only getting worse.,Having lost many skilled,workers during the Revolution,,he needed a system that could,turn malnourished peasants,into red-blooded factory workers.,Lenin's solution was a managerial economy.,- It must have dawned on,him how congenial that was,to that entire structure,that he had erected,of political power.,The Communist party is the,ultimate Taylorist organization.,If you ever saw how things,worked in the Soviet Union,,to the bitter end,,it was this little group,of people take over,,and they, through science,and expertise and technology,,dominate everybody else.,- [Narrator] When Stalin,took Lenin's seat of power,,the Soviet Russia represented,the ultimate expression,of Frederick Taylor's idea,,a complete scientifically managed state.,The promise of,scientifically precise order,and efficiency excited them,,but they weren't the only ones.,- American progressives,weren't getting very far,when it came to politics in the 1920s.,Nobody was paying attention to them,,and they wanted to be admired,,and over in the Soviet Union,,larger scale experiments were,going on, and at one point,,Soviet leaders invited,American progressives,,particularly people in the,union movement, to come over,and admire the Soviet Union,for a fancy junket trip.,- [Narrator] Basically,a glorified field trip,to admire the Soviet Union's achievements,up close and personal.,- In 1927, a group of,progressives went to Russia.,They went over on a boat,called the Roosevelt,,named after Theodore Roosevelt.,- [Narrator] Stalin's guest,list included an assortment,of journalists, intellectuals,,and labor leaders.,Among them were two fanboys,of Taylor's writings,,Rexford Tugwell, an economist,who saw a great need,to reform American agriculture,,which he believed was too,inefficient and wasteful,,and Stuart Chase, a social,theorist who believed,that engineers should be,in charge of government,and run society like a machine.,Both saw much potential,in the centralized economy,of the Soviet experiment,,and the timing of their visit,couldn't have been better.,But even with a generous audience,,Soviet leaders still had a lot to hide.,- You're not getting recognition at home.,You think you deserve recognition.,You go over to Russia and,they unroll the red carpet.,(dramatic music with Russian vocals),(dramatic music),- [Narrator] What they didn't know,was that Stalin meticulously,planned every detail,of their tour, the factories, the farms,,all carefully staged for them,like a perfectly scripted Disney ride.,They saw a lot of Russia,but only the Russia,that Stalin wanted them to see.,- Russia put on a good show,for these Americans to impress them.,They built a modern Potemkin village,,a fake Russia to show the travelers.,They showed them only the good parts.,They sat them down with pretty girls.,They made sure they had a good time,,and they hid the bad parts,,the Soviet government and,the Soviet trade unions,,from these visitors.,- Of course, what they're,never shown are the gulags,and the execution chambers,and the torture chambers,and all these things,,and only educated Western intellectuals,could be stupid enough to believe the kind,of Kabuki theater that,they were being presented,,either by Stalin's Russia or anyone else.,- They were thinking about,work and labor productivity,and the American worker and,the Soviet worker, but Stalin,,he was talking past them.,He was really grandstanding 'cause then he,could say an interview,with the United States,,and he needed what?,Western currency.,Russia was actually desperate,because the Soviet experiment,was actually already failing.,It needed America and it,needed American recognition.,- [Narrator] And if you,impress these intellectuals,and labor leaders, you'll,legitimize the Soviet Union,and create diplomatic ties.,By the end, the junket,left Russia ironically,on a ship called Leviathan,,stuffed to the brim with hopes,of spreading the dream of a reimagined,,fully managed, centrally,planned United States.,- There was always a kind,of fascination with Marxism,and Marxism, Leninism among,American intellectual leftists,,and so a certain predisposition to believe,that America could learn,from Soviet Russia,,that the Soviet experiment was working.,- They all left with one big impression.,""I can have more authority.,I can have more power,'cause the Russians do.,Look, they run the economy.,I could do it, too."",Americans were all interested,in the Soviet experiment.,I've seen the future and it works.,- [Narrator] Journalists,at The ""New York Times,"",""The New Republic,"",and other news sources were,breathlessly favorable.,These voices of the media were,what the Americans trusted,,both working class and,political elites alike.,Walter Duranty, The ""New York,Times"" Russia correspondent,,was especially helpful in,pushing a utopian narrative,about the Soviet Union.,- Walter Duranty, who later,emerged when you read the copy,,is an apologist for,Soviet abuse, for murder,,who helped to cover up the evil,that was happening in the Soviet Union.,- [Narrator] It turns out,,after winning a Pulitzer,that much of what he reported,about the Soviet Union,was, quote, ""some of the worst reporting,to appear in this newspaper."",Those are their words, not mine.,By the time the truth,of what was happening,in the Soviet Union finally,began to surface in the '30s,,the misinformation and propaganda,had already taken root,in many people's minds.,Duranty's influence was cemented,as soon as he won the Pulitzer Prize.,Nevermind the cover ups,over mass starvation.,He had the ear of the people,and of elites like,Franklin Delano Roosevelt,,and when FDR won the,presidency a few years later,,he'd bring along two gentlemen,who saw the Russian experiment firsthand.,They became a part of,FDR's group of advisors,,the Brain Trust,,and the Brain Trust had some new ideas,for how to cure The Great Depression.,- [Announcer] And here it is,,the beginning of the greatest,drama in American affairs,,the creation of a new chief executive.,Roosevelt is the nation's idol here today.,Thousands of Americans are,here to cheer the birth,of a new era in national,affairs, a New Deal era,,which is supposed to pull,the country out of its chaos.,- I am prepared under,my constitutional duty,to recommend the measures,that have stricken the nation,in the midst of a stricken,world may require fraud,,executive power to wage a,war against the emergency.,This nation is asking for,action and action now!,(audience applauds),(tense music),(triumphant marching music),(flames crackle),(slow dramatic music),- [Joseph] The circumstances,under which Franklin Roosevelt,enters office in 1933,,the country's really in a chaotic state.,The stock market crash happens in 1929.,It's been going on now for several years.,- [Amity] Unemployment was over 20%.,We had a national emergency.,People actually were starving.,- [Joseph] The Great Depression,really put so many people,in America on the edge of subsistence,,and so this created a situation,where people were willing,to turn to whatever solutions,they thought might work.,They were desperate for,government to do something.,- The Great Depression and the election,of Franklin Roosevelt in,1932 presented progressives,with a priceless opportunity to put,into practice their,optimistic hopes for the power,of government to solve,social and economic problems.,The Harding and Coolidge,administrations dismantled much,of the machinery of government,that had built up particularly,during the First World War,,and Roosevelt was certain that,if he had the opportunity,,he would rebuild it in a way,that it couldn't be torn down.,♪ All the world on the way to the ♪,- [Narrator] And Roosevelt pledged,to strike a New Deal,for the American worker.,In other words, ""I know you're suffering,,and I have a plan that will fix it.,Trust me."",The predominant view in the,Brain Trust was that the market,was too unstable, too,inefficient, and wasteful.,This depression could only be,tamed by expert bureaucrats.,- These were people basically,in the Roosevelt administration,who weren't necessarily politicians.,They were experts.,Roosevelt really embraces,the idea of expert government,that his Brain Trust is,starting to pitch to him,as the future of American government.,- [Steven] Franklin Roosevelt,and the other New Dealers,were enormously critical of the waste,and inefficiency of,free market capitalism.,- Now we have an industrial economy,with advanced things like,railroads and telephone.,So the world's changed.,So we need to direct,things from Washington.,That was the mindset that,Roosevelt and his Brain Trust had.,They were smarter than the rest of us.,- Franklin Roosevelt had tremendous faith,in experimentation as a means,of solving social problems.,(contemplative music),And he says in one of his speeches,,""We should try something.,Just try it, and if it doesn't,work, try something else,,but above all, try something."",(muffled shouting),- If we would keep faith,,if we would make democracy,succeed, I say we must act now!,- [Narrator] Roosevelt's,government descended,on the country in militaristic fashion,,waging more on this economic beast,and claiming all the executive,power that comes with it,,creating a bunch of new agencies,through a compliant Congress.,- And it's really those,first couple of years,of Roosevelt's presidency,where the most audacious,and wide-ranging,centralized planning efforts,were attempted.,- The centerpiece,of the New Deal was an administration,,the National Recovery Administration,,that regulated business across the board,,including in very confusing ways,,such as how many chickens a,chicken seller could sell,,what price something might be.,- [Narrator] Hundreds of new laws,regulating every little,detail you can think of,,the precise components of macaroni,,the price a tailor could,charge for sewing a button.,Consumers can no longer,pick their own chickens.,And the point of all of this was,to bring the runaway economy,under rational expert control.,- This was basically a,mandate to the president,,the ability to restructure competition,across the entire country.,- [Narrator] And on the heels,of the NRA came the Agricultural,Adjustment Act, the AAA.,More regulation.,The Brain Trust believed,that government expertise,,not the free market,,could dictate the economy,by artificially controlling prices.,- The idea of scientific,management is clearly,what leads to the,Agricultural Adjustment Act,,and the basic notion is we need,to make sure that the farms,aren't producing too much food,because once that happens,,the prices of all of the,commodities will go down,,and that will put the,farmers out of business.,- [Narrator] The AAA,turned over any surplus,of food to the government.,So now with millions of starving Americans,and a government that owns,a surplus of commodities,that could solve that,problem, what did they do?,They destroyed it. Dairies,dumped milk into the sewers.,Train loads of oranges,were soaked in kerosene.,Businesses shuttered, and,people continued to starve,because Roosevelt's inner circle,of experts knew what was best.,- [Joseph] We need to plan,agricultural production,so that the farmers produce less food,so that their prices can say high,so that they can stay in business.,- Suddenly, businesses were saying,,""This New Deal does not work out for us.,There are too many rules.,They're meant to help my business,,but actually, they hurt my business,and keep recovery far away from me."",(soft ethereal music),- And the New Deal really is,the full emergence of this idea,of centralized planning,by administrative experts,,and I think the American people were ready,to take that direction from the government,because they were afraid,for what was happening,in terms of their own families,and their own futures.,All of Roosevelt's policies,really didn't do much,to end The Great Depression.,The Depression continued for many years.,- That is why I am asking the,worker of America to go along,with us in a spirit of,understanding and of helpfulness.,- [Narrator] Despite the,Trust's best thinking,,planning, and experimenting,,the Depression was refusing to disappear.,The New Deal tested the,limits of executive authority,,and the Brain Trust proved,that any government,,given the right crisis, can,transform a country completely,,sometimes for good and,sometimes for the worst.,(triumphant music),It was 1934. One in five,American workers were unemployed.,The experts who staffed,President Roosevelt's,new National Recovery,Administration believed they,could end The Great Depression,by writing strict new,regulations for the market.,- Franklin Roosevelt and the,other New Dealers believed,that they could solve the,problems of those industries,and therefore solve the problems,of American economic life,through the application of technical,and scientific expertise,within the government.,- Nobody knew what the New Deal would be,,but what it did prove pretty fast to be,was a threat to small business,,particularly the National,Recovery Administration,,which had a lot of codes that made it hard,for business to operate.,- [Narrator] But Americans quickly soured,on the National Recovery,Administration's overbearing,and ineffective bureaucracy.,- And the way it all came to a head,was through a chicken business,,chicken butchers in Brooklyn,called the Schechters.,- [Narrator] The Schechter,brothers were Jewish immigrants,who ran a kosher chicken business.,Unlike the economists,at the National Recovery Administration,,the Schechters were,uneducated working class men,,but they knew the poultry business.,Their last name Schechter,was an occupational surname derived,from the Hebrew word for slaughter.,- So these Schechters,,it was in their culture,for their customers, restaurants,,or sometimes individuals,,to pick their chickens.,You wanted to be able to pick,which chicken you were buying,'cause you wanted a healthy,,not a tubercular, chicken.,It was the culture of the,marketplace that they came from.,They were religious Jews.,They sold kosher chickens.,It was very important for their customers,to have chicken choice.,- [Narrator] But according,to the National Recovery Administration,,customers weren't supposed,to choose their own chickens.,NRA inspectors wrote up the Schechters,on 60 code violations,,including some criminal charges.,In addition, the Schechters,allegedly violated NRA codes,that set worker hours,pay, and chicken prices.,- New Deal comes along and,says, ""You're breaking the law.,We're gonna charge you.,You might go to jail."",(slow dramatic music),They find themselves on the,stand, count after count,against them, being,prosecuted by the government,for violating New Deal law.,And in the arguments by the attorneys,,what you can feel is the,arrogance of the expertise.,The lawyers who were prosecuting,the little chicken dealers,really explicitly berated them.,They said, ""How dare,you presume to tell me,what a chicken's price must be?,Only experts can say that.,If you had studied agricultural economics,,you would be an expert, but,you're not an economist.,You're just a little chicken dealer."",So you see that clash,so clearly in this case,,the expert book learning versus,the expert, the common man.,- [Narrator] The case,of Schechter Poultry,Corporation v. United States,went all the way to the Supreme Court.,On May 27th, 1935,,the Supreme Court handed,down its decision,,a unanimous victory for,the Schechter brothers.,- Sometimes it's referred,to as Black Monday,,the day that the Supreme,Court said that the New Deal,and major components of,it were unconstitutional.,- [Narrator] The National,Recovery Administration was dead.,It should have proved to,the Roosevelt administration,that their experts couldn't,regulate the economy back,to health, but FDR didn't,give up on managerialism,,and eventually, the Supreme,Court upheld many other programs,of the New Deal, programs,that may have actually,extended The Great Depression.,- Louis Brandeis, one of the,people who brought the ideas,of scientific management,into the public square,,was now on the Supreme Court,,and he was part of that Supreme Court,that handed down these decisions saying,that the New Deal was unconstitutional.,- [Narrator] Years earlier,,Brandeis helped make the father,of managerialism,,Frederick Winslow Taylor,,a household name.,Brandeis was the one,who told Taylor in 1909,to call his system scientific,management, but now,,Brandeis was saying that,FDR had crossed a line.,- It's a peculiar historical fact, right?,That people credit FDR,with rescuing Americans,from The Great Depression.,Anyone who knows any,history at all knows that we,were still in a deeply depressed,state in the late 1930s.,The evidence is overwhelmingly clear,that he didn't save Americans,from The Great Depression.,He extended the length of the Depression.,- [Narrator] Meanwhile,,what happened to the Schechter brothers?,The government's persecution,cost them everything.,The Schechters spent every,nickel they had on their case.,Their poultry business,,which was doing $20,000,of business every week,before the New Deal,,went down to $2,000 a week,and then went out of business.,On the year anniversary,of the Schechter Supreme Court victory,,The ""New York Times"" reported,that the entire Schechter,family was virtually penniless.,The Schechter case was a momentary,defeat for managerialism,,but there were still plenty of experts,in the government that were certain they,could regulate their way,to a more perfect America.,- What is an expert?,Is it someone with practical,experience in a certain field,,or is it someone with book learning?,The man with experience,,the regular person,,was insufficiently,respected by the New Deal,,and we can experiment with,people because we're clever.,We're professors and they,need us. There's an emergency.,The patient is dying on the,table, the U.S. economy.,Let's operate on his heart,because we are surgeons,who know better than everyone else.,- [Narrator] After World War II,,a new president would,launch his own expansion,of expert rule which he,called the Fair Deal.,Expert economic planning,had taken a major hit,in the Schechter case,,but what about expert housing planning?,(soft ethereal music),(audience cheers),The purview of expert,administration grew bit by bit.,It all started,with Woodrow Wilson's,supposedly modest effort,to offload the minute details,of government administration,,from Congress to disinterested,and efficient experts,until FDR's New Deal.,Now a public that had,endured a Great Depression,and a Second World War,was growing accustomed,to centralized federal power.,Six years of war dramatically,transformed the U.S. economy,and many of its cities.,This brought waves of,migration into cities,,and that unsurprisingly brought,its own housing challenges.,So how does the federal government,solve a problem like housing?,Simple, by throwing money,and expertise at it.,President Truman took,a page from FDR's book,and unveiled a Fair Deal agenda,,which included the Housing Act of 1949.,The FHA poured money into urban renewal,and slum clearance projects.,The government's experts,believed that slums,could be replaced with highly efficient,,self-sustaining public housing.,- The beginning of the Great,Society was urban renewal,,building tall towers to house people,on the principle We knew,how to house people.,- [Narrator] Perhaps no,project was more ambitious,than St. Louis's Pruitt-Igoe Complex.,A massive stretch of,downtown was completely razed,to make room for it, entire,neighborhoods erased.,Up and coming architect Minoru Yamasaki,was selected to design the buildings.,Yamasaki was highly influenced,by a French architect named Corbusier.,Corbusier was a huge fan of,Frederick Winslow Taylor,,and Taylor's principles of,efficiency imbued his work.,Yamasaki wanted to try something,similar for Pruitt-Igoe.,Architecture magazines raved,about his initial designs.,Skip stop elevators stopped,on every third floor.,The idea was both to,maximize the number of units,and to foster a sense of community,by encouraging interaction,between neighbors,,and although he preferred,a mix of building sizes,rather than strictly high rises,,St. Louis officials said no.,- [Amity] He had to work for government,,and government said, ""Well,,this is too expensive.,You have to make this housing more dense."",- [Narrator] Reluctantly,,Yamasaki did it their way,,and up the towers went.,- 33 Towers, 11 stories each,,and the premise was people live in slums.,Let's move them into something nice,,an animal farm in the city, right?,Pruitt-Igoe. These towers are clean.,They have all sorts of amenities,that the homes these,people live in don't have.,They're gonna be happier,,and progress will ensue.,- So we'll take these people,,raze all these private homes,,create the modern towers.,Just the fact that they're,in this modern gleaming place,is going to engender,feelings in the residents,(lawnmower hums),that are gonna lead to utopia.,Well, what happens is the exact opposite.,(dramatic music),- [Narrator] It's hard,to find the right word,for what happened next, tragedy, disaster.,St. Louis officials assumed,the city's population,would keep growing.,It did not.,The same FHA money that,allowed for the construction,of the complex also subsidized,suburban home ownership.,Whites left the city in droves,,making the complex de facto segregated.,(film reel clicks),(tense music),There weren't enough people,willing to live in the towers,,which again were designed,to have maximum occupancy,so that the collected,rent would cover upkeep.,Many of the residents,received government benefits,,so they paid a much lower rate.,Under Missouri law,,welfare benefits came,with a brutal requirement.,A family could only have,one parent, a mother.,The government was paying mothers,to kick fathers out of their homes,,disproportionately,wrecking black families.,Upkeep quickly unraveled as there,wasn't enough money,generated to pay for it.,But Yamasaki's designs,bear some blame as well.,- Because people couldn't get off,on their floor through the elevator,,they had to go on the stairs,,and muggers came and mugged them there.,No one wants to go up and down stairs,'cause that's where the muggers go.,It was true, and Pruitt-Igoe,became very dangerous.,- [Narrator] Light,fixtures in the breezeways,were constantly being smashed,,leaving nightmarishly dark holes,where the worst of things,could and did happen.,- This glorious national symbol,of a public housing project,,instead of becoming heaven, became hell,and was eventually dynamited,in a very sad and dramatic session.,So instead of building,the future American home,,we put people in prisons.,That's what Pruitt-Igoe was.,It was universally hated,by a proud city, St. Louis.,It's still a scar on the cityscape.,- The people had no voice on it.,Science as interpreted by the politicians,in the 20th century took,on an arrogant edge to it,,and, of course, that meant,the rule of the experts,,the rule of the scientists.,(slow dramatic music),We don't know enough.,We know a lot, but we don't know enough.,- [Narrator] Nobody took the failure more,to heart than the architect Yamasaki.,He expressed regret for,his deplorable mistakes,with Pruitt-Igoe.,By the 1950s, he was,giving bitter speeches,about the tragedy of housing thousands,in exactly lookalike cells,,which certainly does not foster our ideals,of human dignity and individualism.,To the Detroit Free Press,,he put it more simply.,""Social ills can't be,cured by nice buildings."",The final towers were demolished,on spectacular display,in 1976.,With them should have gone the hubris,of centrally planned government, but alas.,What did government do instead?,We launched the Great,Society, the next New Deal.,Early progressives were,interested in efficiency,,in making government more efficient,through expert administration.,They hated wastefulness.,Their solution was to run,society like an engineer.,To them, political science,could replace politics.,The New Deal was just,applying that principle.,Centralize as much power over the economy,,over housing, over business as possible.,The Supreme Court may have,reined FDR's program in,,but the administrative state,he helped construct continued,to grow in size and scope anyhow.,When Lyndon Johnson announces,his Great Society initiative,,the goal of this administrative,state is no longer just,about expert control over the economy.,It's far deeper.,- So Lyndon Johnson's Great,Society was an attempt,on the one hand to harness New Deal,,progressive-style government,,faith in expertise,,the attempt to ameliorate the problems,of modern capitalist,industrialist society.,We're not just going to throw,money at the poor and say,,""Okay, we've provided a safety net.,We're going to end poverty."",And you think about how,radical that really is.,We're gonna transform the human condition.,- And this administration today here,and now declares unconditional,war on poverty in America.,- Poverty has been with human beings,since human beings began to,exist, and we're gonna fix that.,We, in our time in 1960s America,,have the wealth and the,resources and the expertise,to transform the human condition,,to permanently end the problem of poverty.,We have the ability in this time, not just,to solve man's material needs, but also,to solve man's cultural,and spiritual longings.,We are going to fulfill,the longings of the soul,through expert government programs.,We're going to bring the,city of God down to earth.,- [Narrator] Utopia was within reach.,All that was required was,enough managerial power,in the hands of the right people.,- So we get food stamps,as a new entitlement.,We get the expansion of Social Security,to include Medicare and Medicaid.,We get increased housing assistance.,- [Narrator] Urban renewal,efforts like Pruitt-Igoe,were a flat-out disaster that left cities,in worse shape than they'd seen before.,Even the more successful,programs fell wildly short,of Johnson's goals.,Shortly after health,entitlements were introduced,,it became clear that there,were crucial gaps in coverage.,High prices to taxpayers and losses,through bureaucratic,inefficiency and fraud,quickly bred increased,government dependence,with an ever increasing,burden on taxpayers,,which caused backlash by,a disillusioned public,,but the damage was done.,- By the latter half of the 20th century,,all the intellectual foundations,for, and the framework of,,the justification for,the administrative state,had been put in place, and,it had, for better or worse,,been widely accepted by the general public,and by the political class.,- [Narrator] But that was,not the original pitch,for the American republic.,At least FDR pressured,a compliant Congress,into signing legislation,for his ambitious programs.,With the Great Society,and greater expansion,of government power over our lives,,this whole three branches,of government thing,was getting tossed right out the door.,- Republics are based on the idea,that we elect people who make the laws,,but most of the laws today,aren't made by Congress.,Most of the laws today are made,by administrative agencies.,(muffled speaking),The rules and regulations that are made,by the national government,are made in EPA, at FDA,,at the FTC, at the SEC,,and all of the alphabet,soup agencies that we know,are the real governing,institutions in America today.,(soft ethereal music),(camera shutter clicks),- [Narrator] Woodrow Wilson,opened a fourth branch,of government, expert,administrators who would deal,with all the little details of regulation,that Congress neither had the time,nor the expertise to handle themselves.,But this fourth branch was,overtaking the other three.,- It now exercises all three,powers of the other branches,,which is a big no no under the,idea of separation of powers,,which is a key component of,our constitutional system.,- The promises that Lyndon Johnson made,about what government could,do for them were unbelievable,and, in the end, unattainable,and have fueled the perception,that government makes promises,that it can't keep that,,that we should be cynical about government,because government is a disaster,,government can't do the things,that it's supposed to do.,It makes promises and doesn't keep them.,- [Martin] What happened,in the 21st century,is a sudden realization by the public,that they were in somewhat,of a parallel position,to the worker in the factory floor.,Don't think, right?,Because the experts know.,- [Narrator] The experts,know more than you do,about what's good for,your personal nutrition.,They know better than you do,about how to keep us all safe.,They know better than,you about your finances.,They know how to protect the environment.,They know how to protect your health.,- [Don] What the COVID episode,showed is that a free people,can indeed be made so scared,that they are willing,,in fact eager, to give up their freedoms.,- The COVID pandemic really,highlighted the ability,of scientific experts,to abuse their powers.,- [Martin] The government,thought it knew more than it did,and then demonstrated it knew,less than it thought, okay?,- The idea that government in an emergency,should respond rapidly,to deal with a crisis,,that's always been part,of American government,,but what's new is the,authority of the science,and the authority of the scientists,to command our allegiance.,All of our decisions,were going to be based,on a model produced by,experts inside the government,who could predict with much more accuracy,than they actually can what would happen,if you just follow their orders.,- When COVID came along,,Anthony Fauci first said this,,and then he said the opposite,,and CDC stood in the way,of developing a vaccine,,and there were all these,moments where the people,in charge seemed to be more,the problem than the solution.,- It soon came to be taken,by the general public,and by the political elite,that they were the experts,,and any questioning of,that was to deny science.,- We should always,remember Richard Feynman's,wonderful definition of science.,""Science is the belief that,the experts are wrong."",Science is about,contestation, not orthodoxy.,- The lesson that I draw from the effects,of the administrative state,is that it's a bad deal.,- America's in the midst,of a really central moment,in its history where,,on both sides of the political spectrum,,there's an increasing distrust,of the people in power.,I think we do need to,rethink the foundations,of modern administration.,We need to restore some,idea of an administration,that is in our control.,- We need experts. We need expertise.,The issue is, will experts have power?,Value expertise but fear expert power.,- [Steven] We actually have,to have the power to say yes,to this expert, no to this other expert.,- If we want a true rule,of experts, in my view,,it would be to decentralize,decision making,as much as possible.,No one is more expert in,what is good for me than me,,and I have an incentive to get it right.,Don Boudreaux is the,world's leading expert,on Don Boudreaux.,- [Narrator] For 100 years,,we've been the guinea pigs,in a grand experiment.,Can managers, experts, and,bureaucrats more efficiently plan,and run our lives than we can?,Does society flourish when a,select few determine the path,for the many?,The time for hypothesizing, theorizing,,and moralizing is past.,The data is in, and it is overwhelming.,No matter how knowledgeable,,the consolidation of power,in the hands of the few,has harmed the governed,every time it was tried.,Experts are critical to,evaluating, judging, and planning.,But if losing our freedom is,the cost of trusting anything,,is it really worth it?,- Things have gotten bad,,people are suffering,,but it's up to us.,I would like us to return,our autonomy to the people.,That we can do, but we,have to choose to do it.,It's not easy.,(dramatic music),It's not clear how you unwind,the administrative state,,but it can be done, and it must be done.,(tense contemplative music)",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Trust_Us-26009938

Thank you.,Whatever the reason,,an interview with him,would be a gold mine.,-Uh, would that gold mine,include covering my raise?,Right!,Because although every,news source in Europe,,including the Monarch Insider,,has tried to get an,interview with the guy,,he's going to give you,,a tabloid columnist,,the time of day?,-I got the Princess of Gibraltar,to admit she laundered money.,I found the Marquis of San,Marino's lover's home address.,I'm pretty sure I can ask a,dodgy Count a few questions.,-Alright, yes.

The Projected Man (1966) - full transcript,"A scientist experimenting with matter transmission by means of a laser beam decides to use himself as a test specimen. But the process goes awry, and one side of his body becomes deformed and lethal to anyone it touches.","(suspenseful music),(pleasant music),(ominous music),(tires screeching),You want to watch where you're going!,Pretty you may be.,(car engine rumbling),Dr. Hill?,[Blonde Woman] Yes.,Professor Steiner is expecting you.,I'm Sheila Anderson, the,department secretary.,Would you come in here, please?,(knocking),Dr. Hill, Professor Steiner.,Come in, come in.,Oh, it's wonderful to see you again.,And piggy to you.,I do apologize.,On the spur-of-the-moment,,I could think of no,other code name for you,to give to the guards.,That wasn't what I meant.,You haven't changed.,Seeing you standing there,as if the years had suddenly dropped away.,Paul, that was a long time ago.,What's the problem that you,want to discuss with me?,(sighing),Oh, thank you, Miss Anderson.,Oh, Miss Anderson, is Dr. Mitchel in?,Yes sir, he went into the lab.,Would you ask him to set up a test run?,I'll be along presently.,At once, sir.,I'm working on the,conversion of solid objects,into pure energy.,Energy which can be stored,in a cell composition,,projected over long distances,and then turned back,into the object again.,All kinds of objects,,including human tissue.,Human tissue?,Yes.,Television!,Television is one method of,transferring a visual image,from one place to another.,But the image is flat, two-dimensional,,lacks life and needs a receiver.,What I have achieved,is the projection of an,object in three dimensions,,something that has weight, depth and body,and without a receiver.,Yesterday,,I achieved my first projection,of a living creature.,Unfortunately, something went wrong,and the subject died.,For how long did it live?,Oh, two to three minutes.,I want you to tell me why it died.,Whether there was any change,in the cellular structure,during projection.,What I need to correct.,What's the principle that you employ?,I'll show you.,Come with me.,Mitchel?,I'd like you to meet Dr. Hill.,She'll be joining us on our project.,You could say we met before.,Well, almost.,Mitchel is an expert on laser.,I'm afraid I know very little about it.,Oh,,well then fit her out with a heat suit,,explain it to her and I'll,go set up the console.,There?,Professor Steiner?,I had to tell Dr. Blanchard,you wanted another experimental run.,And?,He's given his permission,on this occasion.,In the future he requires 24 hours notice.,And you've been instructed,to see that he gets it?,I have.,Dr. Blanchard's the director,of this foundation, isn't he?,You can say that again.,I'm in the middle.,You were going to tell me about laser.,Sorry.,Well, I expect you know it's a way of,overcoming a scattering of light waves.,In it's simplest form, we,put an electric current,through a mixture of,neon and helium gases.,Now the light is amplified and emitted,,it becomes a coherent source of power.,You mean it doesn't go,off in all directions.,Exactly.,It's one very narrow beam,that can transmit more signals,than all the television and,radio channels put together.,It's light in a new form,,which I have modified to,transmit matter itself.,(machinery buzzing),Now I'd like to demonstrate,with something of your own.,Something you'd recognize.,My watch do?,Couldn't be better.,Come with me.,(machinery humming),This is the transmission cradle.,It creates a massive magnetic field.,Now, the watch.,Now, put your visor on and stand back.,But keep your eye on the watch.,(machinery buzzing),What has happened at this stage,is that the basic matter of the watch,has been transformed into pure energy,and is stored over there in that cell.,Forever, if necessary.,Now, we wish to transmit that energy,to project the watch, in fact.,(machinery humming),Laser preheat.,[Chris] Laser preheat in.,(buzzing),[Paul] Laser emission relay.,Laser emission relay...,On.,(electrical pulsing),Relay one.,Relay on in.,(machinery ringing),Relay two.,[Chris] Relay two, on.,(machinery ringing),Project.,(fizzling),Now,,we'll see what happened to your watch.,(machinery powering down),It's incredible.,I succeed every time,with an inanimate object.,If only I could do the same,thing with a living creature.,Unfortunately there's a gap,between the molecular structure of metal,and that of living tissue,,which I must bridge.,What are these burns?,That's some we still,don't quite understand.,Paul, look at the watch.,Would it be possible,for the direction of the,magnetic field, the polarity,,to change in projection?,I suppose it could.,I've never really thought about it.,We better start thinking about it.,If this kind of distortion is present,,no wonder the guinea pig died.,(fizzling),Hot?,No, a shock.,Maybe there is something in my theory.,Look what the shock has done.,(ominous music),No human being could survive,a time transition of that kind.,Not without fearful consequences.,(foreboding music),Who are you?,I'm assisting Professor Steiner.,Who are you?,Dr. Blanchard,,director of this foundation.,Well then you should know,better than to startle me,when I'm focusing a microscope.,Let me see your identification card.,Certainly.,This is a

My hands are tied.,You'll have to use your,position with the ministry,to delay the demonstration,until I found out how far he's got.,Put it off?,After I've spent three exhausting days,heckling the minister to arrange it?,But you have to accept,that things have changed in three days.,He may have achieved some,sort of breakthrough.,I must find out before any,official demonstration...,I'm quite uninterested.,Really, I am.,That demonstration will,take place but it will fail.,Steiner must be discredited,in front of an official party.,[Blanchard] But Latham,,how can I possibly,make sure that it will fail?,If not, there are certain aspects of,your warm and cozy private life,that suddenly will become,much more widely known.,All right!

help?,Well, I could always do with a mate.,Lembach is staying in,London another few days.,Arrangements are being made,for me to have dinner with him,at Blanchard's house.,Well then you'll be,able to

now!,Steiner.,You are behaving inexcusably.,You were only invited,because Professor Lembach,wanted to meet you again,before returning to Geneva.,This is unfair.,My demonstration was ruined.,Demonstrations do go wrong, Paul.,I do not hold it against you.,But I can not remain in London.,I'm needed in Geneva.,My demonstration was sabotaged.,Nonsense.,It's true.,I have evidence.,This

it.,(phone ringing),I want to know why Sheila,put the telephone down.,If he did...,But he said he would call,as soon as he was ready.,I think something's wrong.,I want to go back to the laboratory,and

minute.,Will I be able to recognize them?,No, don't bother.,Just round up a few relatives,for formal identification.,The cause of death, I'm,told, was electrocution.,You better get down there,and see if you can find,out any reason why.,Electrocution?,Yes, I know.,See you later.,Well, let's have a look.,You chaps amaze me.,I barely finish an examination,and here you are putting names to them.,We amaze ourselves sometimes.,Yeah,,that's Lowe all right.,Well, well, well.,I've seen Harry in a good many positions,,but I never expected,to see him in this one.,You silly old fool.,And the woman's here, on the table.,I say she was scared too.,All three had a similar look.,Something else that might interest you.,Another body.,Another?,It, too, died of electrocution.,I thought that damned,Lembach

What for?,Yes, it's Dr. Mitchel, sir.,He's waiting up in your office,with Dr. Hill and Miss Anderson.,There's been some trouble in,Professor Steiner's laboratory.,Is Professor Steiner still here?,Well, he did come in here earlier, sir.,Anybody in the laboratory?,No sir.,Did you want me for anything, sir?,Doesn't matter now.,(knocking),(suspenseful music),Well,,it seems just as well that,I decided to return tonight.,Even so, I find your,explanation pure fantasy.,To me it makes sense.,He was obviously trying,to project himself.,The cross on the map is,exactly on your house.,With these calibrations,he worked out distance and,trajectory from the foundation.,The graph bears me out.,And you are seriously suggesting,that he would materialize,himself in my study?,Well, perhaps not in your study,,but in your house, certainly.,Dr. Hill, I can understand,how upset you are,,but what you suggest is illogical.,There is nothing illogical,in what I am saying.,Then tell me, where is he now?,We can't.,Sheila unwittingly disturbed the program.,He could be anywhere,in any state.,(Sheila whimpering),Do we have to kep Sheila here?,She looks exhausted.,(crying),It's my eyes.,They're hurting.,I'm sorry, Sheila.,Maybe you should see a doctor.,All right, I'll see to it.,It's past 2 o'clock in the morning.,How will you get home?,I can't.,Look, look, look.,You just run to your

music),(whimpering),[Paul] Sheila!,(menacing music),There seems no reason,why Dr. Mitchel and I,can not complete the experiment,just to show what success we've achieved,if for Dr. Steiner's sake.,A nice sentiment, Dr. Hill.,You assume I noticed that,Professor Steiner, himself,,would not be able to continue.,But I didn't mean...,Don't fool yourself, Blanchard.,He has succeeded and once,more he will be back here,,in his office, at any time.,Then, if he retains his faculties,,he will know that it will,not be to much purpose.,Sometimes you're so cruel,that I think you must,have some other

yes.,Wasn't it all right?,No, it wasn't.,How often?,Several times.,Mostly Mr. Latham by himself.,Why didn't you tell me?,Wasn't for me to,question him, professor.,I thought you'd know.,Please, can I go and bath my eyes now?,Did they ask you to keep it as a secret?,Don't worry, I'm not going to harm you.,Did they?,Well, not exactly.,Not exactly?,Either you know or you don't, which is it?,Well, Dr.

seen the very same thing earlier on.,Well, there's no possible doubt,why the lights when out last night.,Somebody's fused the main power line.,You mean, him?,No, he's still be hanging there,,charred

you.,What time did the lights go out?,[Chris] Oh it was about 2:15, wasn't it?,Just about.,Inspector, I will be in,my office when you want me.,[Inspector] Don't leave the building,without letting me know.,I had no such intention.,This experiment Dr.,Blanchard was talking about,,the one that brought you,back here last night,,tell me about it.,[Patricia] Well we,left Professor Steiner,completing

Earth () - full transcript,,"Just look at that.,It's awesome, isn't it?,If not a little terrifying.,A massive tsunami of ice,,cascading down the valley.,Try to imagine that, though,,not just happening here,,but happening all over the world.,Well, 700 million years ago...,..that's exactly what did happen.,Ferocious forces...,..created a climate emergency.,And from pole to pole, across,all of the lands and oceans...,..our world...,..froze.,The story of this extraordinary time,is written in the rocks,,and as the latest evidence helps us,piece together what happened...,..we know this disaster,hit at the worst possible time.,Just as the earliest forms of animal,life were evolving, the ice,threatened to destroy them, and,the world as we know it, forever.,The thing is, this moment,in our planet's history is also,a story of resilience,,because this climatic,and environmental catastrophe lead,to something miraculous.,You see, this new life on Earth,didn't just survive the ice,and its aftermath, it thrived.,The deep freeze saw a new age,on Earth,,an age of complex life,,of a greater size,and diversity than ever seen before.,Life that would go on to,dominate the oceans,and the land to this very day.,Our story begins in Earth's ancient,past...,..850 million years ago...,..when the face of our planet,was unrecognisable.,Almost all the land that existed,was gathered into one,,giant continent, called Rodinia.,Thousands of kilometres,,coast to coast,,this rocky landmass,dominates the planet.,For all its scale,,from its jagged peaks...,..across its desolate plains...,..there are no plants,and no animals.,But there is life here.,In shallow, coastal waters...,..bacteria clump together,into living mats that,cover the seafloor.,For nearly three billion years, this,has been the limit of life on Earth.,A planet that couldn't be more,different from the world we live in.,Even in Iceland, with its harsh,winters, so hostile to life...,..once the warmth returns,,so do a host of plants and animals.,It's honestly hard to imagine,that up until very recently,,this was a dark, desolate and frigid,place, because now look at it.,It's bright, it's busy, it's warm,,it's busy with life doing,what it needs to do at this time,of year, which is flower and fruit.,And look at this lovely,,delicate little harebell here.,And these are the fruits,of the crowberry.,And they're meant to be edible.,Best left for the birds.,But aside from the taste, look at,that, it's a perfect little package.,It's exquisite. But what interests,me more, what's more incredible,,more important, is how this fits,into the grander scheme of things.,All the life here has,evolved in partnership,with everything around it.,Each individual is just one,strand in an intricate web of life.,Every part connected to, and reliant,upon, all the others to survive.,Large, complex life in the,modern world can only really make it,if it's part of a bigger,,interconnected ecosystem, like,this one here, an ecosystem which is,as complex as the life it supports.,But the staggering thing is,,the truly staggering thing is,,that until recently,,none of this existed.,You see,,for over four billion years,,that's pretty much our entire,planet's existence, large,,intricate life like this,was nowhere to be found.,All the animal life that now,exists in the world can,trace its origin back to what,was happening off the shores,of Rodinia, 850 million years ago.,In the coastal waters,,amongst the bacteria,,something new has appeared.,Giant cells tower over,the living mats.,These strange microbes are the,distant ancestors of animal life.,They're not bacteria,,but eukaryotes - bigger,,more complicated...,..the first cells with a nucleus.,The bacterial mats here get their,energy from sunlight, but like,you and me, they eukaryotes rely,on food from their surroundings.,And in this basic ecosystem,,there were slim pickings,,bacteria floating in the water,,and the slow flow of minerals,from the eroding land.,Enough to survive,,but far from,what they need to thrive.,These new life forms seem destined,to live out a meagre existence,stuck on the sidelines...,..never able to evolve into the,vibrant ecosystems of today.,But the planet was about to deliver,a colossal shock to the system...,..thanks to powerful forces,that are still at work today...,..and can be witnessed in places,like Thingvellir,,on the western coast of Iceland.,Walking through here,,I get a real sense of raw, primal,,brutal forces at play, and those,forces certainly are at play.,You see, every year,,the walls of this chasm move,apart by one centimetre.,Now, I know it doesn't,sound like much, but that's,because we've got to start thinking,about this in geological time,,so that's hundreds of millions,of years, not hundreds of years.,The rock beneath my feet is quite,literally splitting in two,,along a fracture which,runs for thousands of kilometres.,Iceland sits on a boundary,between two giant,chunks of the Earth's crust,,known as tectonic plates.,Heat churning within the,mantle of our planet,is driving these plates apart.,As they spread...,..the land above stretches,and then tears...,..creating great rifts,through the landscape.,These forces have been moving,the world's greatest landmasses,,creating and destroying them, for,more than three billion years, and,nothing can resist them, not even,a giant supercontinent like Rodinia.,Deep beneath Rodinia...,..swirling currents of heat cause,tectonic plates to shift.,They begin to move apart...,..and great chasms gape,open across the landscape.,This great continent is ripping,itself apart.,Earth is the only planet,in the solar system to have active,tectonic plates.,And they're constantly,reshaping our world and its life.,In many ways, we can,think of the history of our Earth,as about the interplay,between life and geology,,and sometimes, the great planetary,process have given life,a bit of a leg up.,On others, they've knocked it right,back down again.,One of these moments,was about to play out,,and what happened next would,ultimately defy the entire,living world that we,experience today.,As the rifting continues,for millions of years...,..it creates deep valleys...,..powerful rivers...,..and hundreds of kilometres,of new coastline...,..all greatly increasing erosion,,and causing a flood of minerals to,pour from the land into the oceans.,Thanks to this boost in minerals,,the eukaryote population explodes.,They build numerous colonies,,a crucial step towards forming,multi-celled animals.,And some organisms now,have enough energy,to produce protective spikes...,..built from all those,minerals washed off the land...,..and vital defences,,as there were now predators taking,advantage of the boom in numbers...,..in this newly energised ecosystem.,We've witnessed this dramatic change,with our own eyes,,thank to recent discoveries made,in 700 million year-old rocks,from the Grand Canyon.,Scientists have discovered these...,..tiny micro-fossils of marine life,,each smaller than a grain of sand.,What shocked them were the holes,in the outer shell,,most likely created when they,were attacked and eaten.,Now, the predators,weren't preserved,,but the best guess is that they,were something like...,..this...,..a single celled amoeba called,Vampyrella.,This predator punches holes,in its victims,before sucking,out their inners...,..leaving behind holes,near identical,to those found on the,micro-fossils.,This is the earliest evidence,of predators and prey ever found.,That element of everyday life,,so key to our modern world.,The vast tectonic processes at work,provided complex life with,the spark that it needed,,an environmental revolution,which allowed it to move towards,the interconnected ecosystems,that we see around us today.,But just as life was taking,this great leap forwards,,disaster struck.,The forces tearing the ancient,supercontinent apart were about,to plunge the entire world into a,seemingly endless, desolate winter.,On Rodinia, events take,a catastrophic turn for the worse.,Superheated magma bursts,through the surface,,as rifting thins,the crust in multiple places.,Molten rock swamps two million,square kilometres,of the continent...,..one of the largest,outpourings in Earth's history.,The lava cools,and forms the dark rock basalt...,..creating a vast black stain,across the heart of the continent.,You see, the great freeze begins,not with ice...,..but with fire.,Fresh basalt is quite,incredible stuff.,This is about ten months old.,Now, it's not terribly easy to walk,over, and you certainly,wouldn't want to stumble.,It's extremely jagged,,ripping your boots to pieces,,and you wouldn't,want to fall on that, would you?,But what's really incredible,about this rock is that it has,the capacity to,change our planet's atmosphere.,As rain forms, it absorbs carbon,dioxide gas from that atmosphere.,When that rain flows over basalt,,there's a chemical reaction,that draws carbon dioxide,out of the water,and binds it to the surface,of the rock, locking it away.,We know that carbon dioxide is,a very potent greenhouse gas,,has the capacity to lock,lots of heat into our atmosphere,,and the more of it that we,pump into the air,,the more we see our global,temperatures rising.,But then, I don't need to tell,you about global warming.,What's interesting is that,the reverse is also true.,If we take carbon dioxide out of the,atmosphere, temperatures fall.,The erosion of millions upon,millions of tons of basalt,,spewed up when Rodinia broke apart,,sucked that warming,blanket of carbon dioxide,out of the atmosphere.,And it flicked the,Earth's thermostat,from a comfortable stasis to chill.,Falling levels of carbon dioxide...,..pushed down temperatures...,..awakening a sinister force.,Ice...,..something not seen here on the,planet for a billion years.,For now, it's limited to the poles.,But it's spreading.,Whether you're a microscopic,or more human-sized,,most life loves the warmth...,..especially here in Iceland, where,the winters are so harsh.,Summers here are truly amazing -,look how verdant, how green,,how lush it is.,And there's also a tremendous,diversity of plants -,flowers, mosses, dwarf trees.,And, of course, on a day like today,,blue sky, sunshine - it's lovely.,But the lingering cold of winter,is never too far away.,Venture up into that,lingering cold...,..and it's possible to see how life,suffers as temperatures fall.,I've only travelled about a mile,,but I've climbed in altitude,,and the difference in the landscape,is really rather stark.,Look at it.,It's principally barren rock,and the plants here are scattered,few and far between.,You see, up here,,the temperature only,gets above five degrees Centigrade,for a few weeks of the year,,and when the temperature,drops below that,,plants can't produce,structural tissues.,You can give them all the water,,all the nutrients they want,,but at lower temperatures, they just,can't build their own bodies.,Across the world, whenever,temperatures drop low enough,,for long enough,,plants and life slowly fade away.,Temperature is the natural limiter,for complex life in our world,,and those rich,,interconnected ecosystems,,which can thrive down there,can't even survive up here.,When it gets cold,,the web of life unravels.,On the ancient Earth,,as temperatures continue to fall,,the cold advances on early,life from all sides.,Armadas of sea ice march out from,the North and South Poles...,..as on land, immense glaciers surge,forth from the mountains.,The places life can,hold on are rapidly shrinking.,The ancient Earth teeters on the,edge of a climate catastrophe,,as the ice tightens its grip.,Today, ice covers a tenth of,all the land on the planet.,Vast sheets blanket the poles...,..and the high mountains of,all of the continents.,Nearly 10% of Iceland is,covered by a single sheet of ice.,The icecap here is vast.,It stretches for 100 kilometres in,that direction.,It's 140 kilometres wide and nearly,a kilometre thick in some places.,But in the modern world, ice,is limited.,It comes to a grinding,stop down there.,And that's not just because of,human-induced climate change.,The world is simply too warm.,The idea that ice could,smother the whole world,seems incomprehensible.,But just over 710 million years ago,,the Earth was a much more,vulnerable place,,and when the ice started marching,,there was very little to stop it.,We now know just how far it reached.,Look under the leading,edge of this icecap,and you can see the evidence,of its raw power in the countless,chunks of rock ripped up,and dumped by the ice.,Glaciers are so destructive,,they leave scars in the rock record.,Like these stones and boulders,,a completely different type or,rock to the layers around them.,Called drop stones, the flowing ice,picked them up and dropped them,hundreds of kilometres,from where they originated.,Scientists have found these in rock,layers that were sat over,the equator 700 million years ago...,..hinting at an event,of an astonishing scale and reach.,The ice is winning.,A band of warmth still holds,out around the equator...,..the last refuge for life.,But as the white expanse spreads,,more and more heat is,reflected back into space...,..and the,freeze becomes a runaway process.,Ice surges over almost,all of the remaining oceans.,Even at the equator,,hope slowly fades.,And finally,,this last stretch succumbs...,..leaving the planet a frozen,,white marble...,..floating in the darkness of space.,Ice had claimed the world...,..in an event known,as Snowball Earth.,It's almost impossible to imagine,,but pretty much all of the planet,was just like this.,The whole world was plunged into,a deep Ice Age, wrapped in sheets,of ice sometimes kilometres thick,,choking our land and our oceans.,It was a global winter,with no end in sight.,Modelling suggests that it was,minus 70 degrees Centigrade,at the poles...,..that it never got above,freezing anywhere on the planet.,It would have been pretty sterile.,It would have stressed or stalled,the water cycle.,There would have been little,or no evaporation...,..hence no rain,,no snow,,very few clouds.,If there were clouds, some would,have been clouds of carbon dioxide.,This was an incredibly,hostile place.,It couldn't have been more different,than the beautiful, vibrant,,dynamic planet that we have today.,The triumph of the ice,is a disaster for life.,The ocean is almost entirely,cut off from the atmosphere.,It's dark, cold.,And the flow of minerals,from the land slows to a trickle.,The food web begins to fall apart.,And the predecessors,of animal life...,..falter.,A mass dying is under way.,This was no short cold snap,life could easily ride out.,OK, the ice would have waxed,and waned a little,,with the changing of the seasons,,but the cold persisted,,unending,,for millions upon millions of years,,with no hope of release.,I know it looks like a massive,,muddy field,,but I'm actually walking on top,of a glacier, albeit a dirty one.,And out here, in the biting,face of the cold, it's easy to,imagine that the endless winter put,pay to complex life on Earth.,But of course, it didn't.,Live survived.,You and I are living,,breathing proof of that.,But when it comes to looking,for the clues that might tell us,how it pulled off its great,survival trick, these wild,,frozen places are a top,place to look.,You see, even on the exposed,top of the glacier, it's possible,to find chinks in the ice's armour,,just big enough for life to exploit.,Here we are. This is what,we're looking for.,This, we think,,is very similar to what might,have formed way back then.,Some dust blew out onto the glacier,,was warmed up by the sun,,it melted the surface of the,ice and formed this puddle.,They're called cryoconites, and it's,this simple combination of dust,and water which proved,to be life's saviour.,Now, I know it doesn't look,like much, but this is, in fact,,a beautiful little oasis out,here on top of this vast glacier.,Yes, in this one small,pool of water, there's abundant,minerals from the dust, and plenty,of exposure to the air and sunlight.,As astonishing as it sounds,,that means it's possible,to find life,in muddy puddles like this.,The simplest would be single celled,algae and bacteria,,but there are others.,These are images that have,come from an actual cryoconite.,You've got things,like this rotifer here,,and here, our favourite little water,bear, the tardigrade.,And they would be feeding on those,smaller organisms.,And, all together,,a soup here of different animals,and plants in a simple food web.,Now, I've got to tell you, I've,seen life in some pretty amazing,places in my time, but the idea,that there could be a functional,ecosystem living in a puddle,,on top of Europe's largest glacier?,Well, that is quite extraordinary.,It's thought that during Snowball,Earth, there would have been,enough patches of exposed rock,and land to generate dust.,Not as much dirt as this, but enough,to create many similar puddles.,And, what's more, scientists have,exposed these tiny oases,in the laboratory to conditions,found on Snowball Earth...,..and the life inside survived.,For no less than 50 million years,,50 million years, that's,a long time, life clung on in such,places throughout the deep freeze.,Let's be clear,,this was a tough place to exist,,but if life wanted to do more,than survive, if it wanted to,flourish, then the Earth would,have to escape its icy prison.,There was no easy route out.,The ice prevented almost,any change on the planet...,..with one exception.,Even an endless winter can't stop,the planet creating volcanoes.,Each eruption punching through,the planet's frozen shell.,Ever since our planet first formed,,the heat in its mantle,has fuelled volcanoes.,Today, there are over 1,000 active,across the world.,And there would have been at least,as many during Snowball Earth.,But even the ferocious heat of,all that molten rock was too,fleeting to break,the grip of the global Ice Age.,What did offer a slim,chance of escape was something else.,Something invisible that,came with each eruption.,As each eruption tore,through the ice,,it released a great slug,of volcanic gases,,including the carbon,dioxide stripped from the atmosphere,all those years ago.,With the land and ocean covered,in ice, there's nothing to stop,the slow build up of this,powerful greenhouse gas.,And it begins to finally bring some,warmth to the frozen planet.,The world stood on a knife edge.,If enough carbon dioxide,could build up, there was,a chance of breaking the freeze.,What would finally decide,the planet's fate is a process,we're all too familiar with today.,This glacier has been,melting for the last 130 years,,and the evidence of that melt,is all around us.,Look at this vast,,glacial lagoon here, full of bergs,and brash ice, and there's meltwater,draining out into the sea.,This is global warming.,And the key thing is that this,process has accelerated,in the last 30 years.,You see, just as freezing is a,runaway process, so too is melting.,Rising temperatures drive more water,vapour into the atmosphere.,It has a powerful,greenhouse effect.,And, as ice melts,,the exposed dark surfaces absorb,yet more warmth from the sun.,Changes like these,feed into each other,and create tipping points, beyond,which warming becomes explosive.,To limit climate change today,,we must avoid reaching,these tipping points.,But for Snowball Earth,,they couldn't have come soon enough.,What started as a trickle...,..has become a torrent.,As the ice starts to melt,,the exposed dark surfaces,suck in ever more warmth,from the sun.,The melt becomes unstoppable.,A runaway train that releases,a staggering deluge of water.,Sea levels rise two metres,every decade,,swallowing great,chunks of coastline.,After a total of over 50 million,gruelling years in deep freeze...,..the world is finally reborn.,Snowball Earth was an unprecedented,assault on our planet.,An astonishing moment that left no,corner of the world unscathed.,You and I are here because,,through it all, life survived.,But as tenacious as it was,,that life was still single-celled,and still trapped,in the microscopic world.,But this is more than just,a tale of simple survival.,In the shattered remains,of the great freeze, the stage was,set for a revolution that would,change beyond all recognition.,It's easy to assume that life,progresses in a straight line,,steadily becoming more complex,,more advanced.,But in reality, it's often not like,that. Often it relies upon a great,shock to the system, a state change,,to flip life onto another path.,After which, that life,and the world in which it lives,,are never the same again.,Snowball Earth was,just such a moment.,The ice of the great freeze,had shredded the surface,of our planet...,..ripping up millions upon,millions of tons of rock,and dumping it into the oceans.,This sudden flood of resources,causes single-celled algae,and bacteria to flourish throughout,the waters of the world.,Their vivid blooms so large they're,visible from space...,..stretching across entire oceans.,Growth on such a staggering scale,has the power to change,the entire ecosystem.,All this photosynthesising,greatly increases,levels of oxygen in the water,,an element vital for complex life.,When the algae and bacteria,eventually die, billions upon,billions drift down to the bottom,,a rain of organic matter...,..adding to millions of years,worth of dead things that have built,up over the history of the oceans.,And bacteria living at the,bottom of the ocean gorged,themselves on this dead matter...,..reprocessing it and releasing,a steady stream of minerals,back into the water column...,..giving our ancient ancestors,a plentiful, sustained source,of food, oxygen and nutrients,,all supplied by life itself.,At this moment, for the first,time ever, life and the planet,come together to become,complimentary cogs spinning in,a great nutrient recycling machine,,which is providing life with,exactly what it wants in quantities,that it's never had before.,And as a consequence,,life explodes.,And after around half a billion,years of struggle,,Earth's fledgling spring is,set to become a glorious summer.,In shallow coastal waters,across the planet, life blossoms.,These may look like plants,,but they are the first animals.,Leaf-shaped Charnia,feed on passing nutrients...,..whilst Attenborites float,freely on the tides.,They're the descendants of those,first tiny eukaryote pioneers,,now evolved into myriad,strange forms,,all of which have finally broken,free of the microscopic world.,These are creatures of a complexity,and size that we could see,,could reach out and touch.,All living with,,and supported by, an ecosystem,just as intricate and remarkable,as any on Earth today.,These first truly complex,living creatures,are now long gone.,But they were the first to take,this great leap,,and once they had, for life,,there was no looking back.,All thanks to Snowball Earth,lighting the fuse.,Snowball Earth was,an astonishing period,,when life, land and the climate,were in conflict like never before.,When that long winter ended,,the stage was set for evolution,to run riot.,And finally, it's created,all of the fantastic scale, the,remarkable diversity and the amazing,beauty of life on Earth today.,How do scientists study the bizarre,animal life of the Ediacaran,,which lived more,than 500 million years ago?,So, this is a wonderful fossil from,Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire,in the UK, and it was found by,schoolchildren in the '50s.,While it looks,superficially like a plant,,because it lived in very deep water,,we know it can't have lived,off the light, been photosynthetic.,Instead, it fed from the little,bacteria and the dissolved organic,carbon that were floating past it.,These creatures are so unusual,,understanding how they interact,with each other can be difficult.,Now, thanks to advanced laser,technology,,scientists can learn more about them,than ever before.,So, by laser scanning these fossils,,we've got,a three-dimensional surface,,and what this means is, you have,essentially a snap-shot of Ediacaran,life captured on the rock surfaces.,To date, we have over 20,000 fossils,that we've laser scanned,,and using different,sorts of statistics,and mathematical approaches,,we can then work out what,they were doing and how they were,interacting with each other.,And analysing spatial patterns,within the scans has revealed,why some of these creatures,grew so big.,For a long time, we thought that,the reason they got large,and grew things like stems was to,get food without having to compete,,and what we found is that, actually,,competition's very, very rare.,Being big wasn't,an advantage for getting food,,but what it was,an advantage for was ensuring,that your offspring got to go as far,as possible, because the taller,you are, the further your offspring,will travel in the water column.,And the scans have also led to the,discovery that some organisms,had unexpected behaviours.,We actually found something rather,surprising. They don't always,reproduce sexually.

Body on the Beach () - full transcript,,"Annie didn't feel lonely.,Even if she was alone, she was,independent, she was strong.,She wanted to explore new things,in life, do something new.,If she wanted to do something,,she did it.,I remember Annie as a very happy,,very lively girl.,She enjoyed music,,she enjoyed dancing.,With her long, thick blonde hair,,she was like a Viking princess.,She was a great friend,,taken from us too soon.,This programme contains some scenes,which some viewers may find upsetting,and deals with Suicide.,I was just walking along,Prestwick Beach.,When I got to about the curve,coming up here,,I looked over and she was lying,head in against the wall.,She wanted to come back to Sweden.,PHONE RINGS,Then this terrible phone call -,Annie had been found dead.,15:14 is the first sighting of her,and she's on her own.,When she comes back into the airport,she looks distressed. What happened?,She was in a good mood.,She didn't seem depressed at all.,It doesn't add up.,There was nothing to indicate that I,was dealing with a potential murder.,Now, if what the family,is saying is true,,then you're talking about,a potential cover up.,Obviously, there's ways and means,of deleting phone records.,People who can do that,are the security services.,We want to know the truth,,whatever it is.,My dad's from this part of Scotland.,My granny used to stay,just up there.,I've got tonnes of happy memories,here.,But now I've got a different,association with this place.,This is the spot right here,where Annie's body was discovered,on a winter's morning.,I was only 13 when Annie died,but the story of her death,has always stayed with me.,We all know that when terrible,things happen to women,,sometimes their stories,just aren't taken seriously,by the people that are supposed,to be looking after them.,And even though Annie died,18 years ago,,it feels like a story,we could have heard yesterday.,And many people, her friends,and family included,,believe that Annie,was actually murdered.,The question is, though,,could they be right?,I want to find out what,really happened to Annie.,And the best place to start,is the day she was found,right here on this beach.,TICKING,It's a Sunday morning, you've,got a report of a female body,having been discovered,on Prestwick Beach.,My name is Michael Neill,and my connection with,the Annie Borjesson case was,I was the detective on duty,the morning Annie's body,was discovered.,You've got a young female,who's dead on the beach.,To err on the side of caution,it was treated as a crime scene.,The crime scene manager attended,,along with scenes of crime officers,,who were going to photograph it, but,we were in a race against time here,to get Annie's body off the beach,before the tide was upon us.,A bag was sitting beside her,,her jacket was beside her.,Her wallet was still there,,her passport was still there.,Annie was a Swedish,foreign national.,We contacted the Swedish,police authorities,to pass on a death message.,Annie was my best friend.,She had told me that she was going,to come home to Sweden to visit me,and stay at my house,for a couple of days.,And she had great plans,what she wanted to do.,My son was preparing his room,for her to be able to have.,PHONE RINGS,Then this terrible phone call came.,I thought it was Annie and I was,so happy running to the phone.,And then I heard her sister's voice,and I was...,..shocked to hear,Annie had been found dead.,PHONE RINGS,Her mother called me,and told the tragic,that had happened in Scotland.,That day and some days after,were not so funny.,Erm...,It isn't fair.,It's a cruel world we're living in.,One of the things I've done,a lot as a journalist,is spend time tracking down material,like documents, reports and photos,that can help get to the truth,in a case like this.,It's not the most glamorous,part of the job,,but it sometimes gets the results.,This is a document that I've tracked,down from the Swedish authorities.,Now, it is in Swedish,,but I've had it translated,,and what it says is that Annie,Borjesson was found drowned,in the water at Prestwick and that,the Scottish police suspect suicide.,But you need to take,a look at the date.,This letter is from,December 5th, 2005.,That's only one day after,Annie's body was discovered,,so, if you think about it,,there's been no postmortem,,there's been no investigation,into her death,,yet the Scottish police are already,telling the Swedish authorities,that they suspect suicide.,When the Scottish police,said suicide,,it was a devastating time.,And first thoughts was,,no, this must be a mistake.,Not Annie.,The Scottish police said it was,a suicide just within some hours.,But what I know her for...,..20 years or something like that,,no, definitely not.,I've managed to get my hands,on Annie's postmortem.,There's loads of details in it,and some of them are pretty graphic.,Now, I'm not an expert,on this kind of stuff,,and I could use some help,in understanding it.,This is the guy.,Now, he seems to have literally,written the book,on death by drowning.,I'm Dr Stuart Hamilton.,I'm a Home Office-registered,forensic pathologist.,I've got 14 years of experience,of suspicious deaths and murders.,And I'm one of the co-authors,of the guidelines,on autopsies in drowning.,It is the most detailed,medical examination,a human being will ever undergo.,And with that comes,an immense responsibility.,In Annie's case, there are no,significant injuries present.,There's no evidence of trauma.,The vast majority of the examination,is recorded as normal.,The doctor concludes that,death was due to drowning.,Having read that report,,I would agree that she has drowned,,but as a forensic pathologist,,that raises the question,of how she came to drown.,Any time the police are asked,about Annie's case,,they insist that they did it all,right,,so you'd think that they'd be,happy to talk about it, right?,But we have contacted a dozen police,officers involved in this case,and pretty much nobody,wants to speak about it.,But one man who is prepared to,is retired detective Mick Neill.,He wasn't in charge,of the investigation,but he is willing to talk,about his role.,As part of the investigation,,a timeline was established,to try and get a picture,of what's happened,leading up to Annie's death,on the beach that day.,We reviewed hours and hours,of CCTV at Prestwick Airport,and eventually got her on the,walkway over into the airport.,She was alone.,We lose her out of camera,,then she appears back,,goes out one of the doors,for a matter of minutes,,and then comes back in,,comes back across the walkway,,still alone...,..and then she goes out,of the airport.,She's seen heading down,towards the beach area.,It's so common when people,take their own life,that it's a snap decision,,a decision that's made in a second,,and that changes everybody's life,around about them.,Now, that is definitely Annie,,there.,You know, she's got her passport,on her,,but instead of catching,that flight back home,,police believe that Annie then,left the airport,,walks to the beach,and drowns herself.,But is that credible,and does it fit with the evidence?,It looked someone had pressed,their thumbs,standing in front of Annie,,and with matching finger bruises,on her back, like someone had hold,her, grabbed her, around the throat.,The family saw,this big, big bruising,from the temple, over her nose,and down to her cheek.,It was a huge bruising.,All these are not mentioned,in the Scottish autopsy.,We got angry, upset, devastated.,I think that something very,terrible happened to Annie.,Annie was murdered.,CAMERA CLICKING,Now, if what the family,is saying is true,,then the implications of this,are massive.,I mean, you're talking about,a botched police investigation,and you're talking about,a potential cover up.,I mean, those allegations,are just huge,but could it actually be true?,I mean, how likely is it really,that Annie's body,was discovered with the injuries,that the family describe?,Could they be mistaken?,Well, I've dug a little deeper,and I've found evidence,that on her way back home to Sweden,,Annie's body was handled by,another undertaker in London.,I've got my hands on this letter,from the person who picked,Annie's body up.,""The deceased was collected,from the hospital mortuary,""and her condition,was extremely poor.,""In respect to her bruises,,I can verify that she did have,""significant bruising to her body,,which, for reasons I cannot explain,,""I believe were not included,in the autopsy report.,""I find this to be quite unusual,""considering the circumstances,of her death."",Now, this is really significant,because it means that,two separate undertakers,in two different countries,think that the marks,that they saw on Annie's body,were bruises.,So it does seem like there,were marks on her body,but I wonder what they were.,What creates a bruise is damage,to the small blood vessels,just under the skin and they leak.,The pressure in your blood vessels,from your heart beating,pushes the blood into the tissue,around the damaged vessels,and that produces a bruise.,Dead people do not bruise.,So what I have here is a photograph,that the family took,when Annie was repatriated,to Sweden.,There's a limited view,but there is certainly bluish,discoloration around the face.,And particularly down,onto the cheek,,there is a more dense,,purplish-type discoloration.,I have to say that simply,looking at this,,it looks like a bruise.,A bruise is blunt trauma.,It's not recorded in,the first postmortem report.,I would have expected that,to be recorded and it's not,,and that needs to be explained.,There's pretty convincing evidence,that the family are right,when they say the marks,on Annie's body were bruises.,But there's one piece of,evidence,which could determine once and,for all whether that's the case.,Look here. It turns out that,during Annie's postmortem,,multiple photographs are taken by,a police photographer at the time.,Now, these photos could,hold the answer,,so I've submitted a Freedom of,Information request for the photos,taken during Annie's postmortem,,which should take a few weeks,to get a response.,But hopefully soon we can start,to get some answers.,One shock led to another.,The family started to clean her,and prepare her for her own clothes.,Afterwards, Gun phone me.,When she told me about that,the hair had been hacked off,,it felt so wrong, so bad.,Somebody had desecrated Annie.,Her hair was a part,of her personality.,I mean, where's the rest,of her 80cm of hair?,At one point, the police, they,said she hacked it off herself.,Depressed people do so.,Annie's family have never accepted,the fact that her death,was classed as a suicide.,A lot of families can't accept,their loved ones have taken,their own life.,There was never anything at all,in the whole investigation,to indicate that there was,any criminality involved,in Annie's death.,So the police were telling,Annie's loved ones,that she could have been depressed,at the time she died,,but she didn't have a history,of depression.,Was she in a state of mind that,might lead her to take her life?,So, what do we know about Annie?,Her full name is Annie,Kristina Borjesson.,She was born near Malmo,in Sweden in 1975.,She's a really talented linguist.,She speaks six languages,,which is pretty unbelievable.,One of the things Annie loves most,in the whole world is music.,She's a music college graduate,,she plays in a band -,Annie and the Wolves.,SONG PLAYS,It's really funny hearing,her voices, isn't it?,This is actually one of the few,recordings of Annie.,SONG PLAYS,My name is Micke Persson.,I'm an old friend of Annie and,her family since the late '80s.,It's nice.,It's nice.,It's strange to hear in some way.,This is how I remember Annie.,The little rock star,and a happy smile.,We had known each other,for many, many years,,and then we had a fling,or what you can call it -,a small, small relationship to,see if we would fit together,,but, no, we didn't, but we were,still really good friends.,Annie could really,look after herself,and she was a strong individual.,Annie didn't take her life.,Definitely not. Not a chance.,So the people who knew Annie,back in Sweden didn't believe,that she was depressed,,but they were hundreds of miles away,and they hadn't seen her for months.,So what about someone, then,,that knew her in Scotland?,I started working at,The Scotch Whisky Experience.,So that's where I met Annie.,I remember Annie as a very happy,,very lively girl.,She wasn't shy in voicing,her opinion about things.,It's very strange to have been one,of the last people that they know,saw Annie and spoke to Annie.,On the Friday I was working,an evening shift,,I sat down in the staffroom,,and there was a knock on the door.,It was Annie just standing there,,smiling. ""Hiya"",She was in a good mood.,She didn't seem depressed at all,,she was very happy,,and everything seemed to be,just normal.,Hearing that the police,concluded very quickly,that Annie committed suicide,,it just doesn't add up in my mind.,So we know that the friend,who spoke to Annie,said that she was behaving normally,and she seemed happy.,And this was the day,before she died.,But one of the things that the,police said to Annie's family,was that she could have been,depressed and that might have been,a reason that she cut her hair.,But look here...,This is the last CCTV image,of Annie at Prestwick Airport.,Now, the police say,that this was taken,just a few hours before she died,and you can clearly see that her,hair is all the way down her back.,Is it really credible that Annie,cut off 80cm of her hair,between leaving the airport,and arriving at the beach,just a few hours later?,I need to ask someone,who's qualified to know.,My name is Dr Keri Nixon.,I'm a consultant,forensic psychologist.,I work on a kind of profile of,a suspect, profile of a victim.,The police put forward,a potential explanation,that Annie could have cut her own,hair as an act of self-harm.,Now, there's footage of her at the,airport that shows her hair is long,,so at some point from leaving the,airport to going into the water,,she gets out scissors,and cuts her hair?,I've worked with people in my clinic,who have severe anxiety.,It can include pulling at the hair,and pulling hair out.,It can include taking out,your own eyelashes.,You know, this is a known anxiety,response, particularly in females.,But to apply that to those few hours,at the point that the police say,she's going from the airport,to the beach, it just doesn't,make any sense to me.,I mean, if Annie didn't cut,her hair, then who did?,And why did the police say that,she might have been depressed,in the first place?,There are so many,unanswered questions.,I mean, I wonder how thorough,the police really were,,so to try and find an answer,I want to go back, right back,,and track down the person,who first found Annie's body.,Come on, then.,Typical December. I was just,walking along Prestwick Beach,as normal.,When I got to about the curve,coming up here,,I saw legs.,I looked over,and there was the body.,She was lying head in,against the wall,and legs pointing outwards.,I felt helpless, you know?,There was nothing I could do.,I just slumped down onto the wall,and phoned the police.,Ten minutes and there was,a constable here,and he took all my details and said,that they would get in touch with me,if they needed me.,Never heard from them again.,I thought I would hear something.,I thought, you know,,they would contact me to...,..I don't know, get a bit more,detail and that, but...,It was surprising that they never,,I would say, for me.,The first time I heard about it,again was in the newspaper.,On the day Annie's found dead,,David is the only witness,that the police have,,so why didn't they speak,to him again?,Had they already made up their mind,about what happened to Annie?,When the body is found at 8:30,and it's in the mortuary by 10:10,,which is 20 minutes away,,it seems unlikely that...,..everything that needed to be done,was done forensically.,It's suggesting that the decision,as to what has happened to her,has already been made.,There is not concern,that a third party,could have been involved,in this death.,A young woman found dead outdoors,is always a matter of concern.,It wasn't that it was just assumed,it was suicide and nothing was done.,There was hours and hours,of police work done.,There was nothing to indicate that I,was dealing with a potential murder.,We didn't find anything,because there was nothing to find.,Remember, I've submitted,a Freedom of Information request...,..for the photos taken,during Annie's postmortem,just so that they can be looked at,by an independent expert.,Well, I've just had a response...,..and the answer is no.,And the reason that they've given,for this is that they say,it's not in the public interest,to release these photos.,Now, I'm not the first person,to get a knock-back like this,because time and time again, Annie's,family have requested these photos.,And each time they've been refused,as well.,Now, the authorities say that,the reason for this refusal,is because it's not,in the family's interest...,..even though they're the ones,requesting them.,So it's just like they're,being gaslighted, really.,I don't understand,the decision making around that,and that could be easily rectified.,Just show those photographs.,It makes it look like,there's something to hide.,And that's either poor decision,making or there's something to hide.,She is saying that somebody,is following her,,that somebody is reading her emails.,She's very anxious,and feels threatened.,That's where you start to think,,what is going on here?,You can't do that if you're,a member of the public.,People who can do that, of course,,are the security services.,Why has that been marked,as classified?,When she comes back into the,airport, she looks distressed.,What happened at the airport?",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Body_on_the_Beach-21155252
